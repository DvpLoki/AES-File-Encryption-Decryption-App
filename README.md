# AES-File-Encryption-Decryption-App
Its a streamlit App that can Encrypt and Decrypt any type of file.
<br>
Here i have used a modified version of AES which is my Final year project , that is more secure and in pure python.
<br>
In the streamlit App, i have used AES-128 in which StdMAES is compatible with 128,192,256 bit keys.
